Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) Roadmap
=========================================
---------------------------------------------------------------
*Scott Collis, Cory Weber, Jonathan Helmus and Zachary Sherman*
---------------------------------------------------------------


Introduction and Aims
=====================
Everyone one who uses weather radar to do science uses, in one form or another,
radar software. Software is a science enabling piece of infrastructure and good
software minimizes frustration and allows the domain expert to get to 
understanding the phenomena being studied without needing to be an expert on
numerics, data informatics and software engineering.

There are several platforms for interacting with radar data, the open source
variants are well documented in (Heistermann et al 2014). The Python ARM Radar
Toolkit (Py-ART, Helmus and Collis, 2016) is one of these. 

Py-ART grew out of a collection of radar algorithms generated in support of the
new radar capability in the ARM program (Mather and Voyles, 2012). One of the
first contributions was a Linear Programming (LP) technique for separating
propagation polarimetric phase shift from other local impacts (Giangrande el at,
2013). As the collection of both algorithms and radars grew it became clear that
the problem would become intractable unless a carefully designed architecture was designed that allowed application chains to be developer via a common data model approach.

Shortly after, in early 2012 development on Py-ART began in earnest with the
support of the ARM program. In September of 2012 Py-ART was uploaded to the
social coding platform GitHub at https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart. Py-ART was
unofficially bumped to version 1.0.0-Dev in May of 2013 and publicly released.
The first "stable" release was 1.2.0 in February of 2015 and the most recent
release was 1.7.0 in September of 2016. Release notes can be found here: https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart/releases.

   lines are automatically generated by Cython to C complilation.

Figure 1 shows the growth of the project as a function of time broken down by
contributor. Note that some of the code is C which has been generated by Cython
which inflates the number some what. 

Py-ART has benefited from code from 15 individual contributors. This has been
enabled by careful implementation of unit tests and continuous integration.
Every time a pull request is submitted against the Py-ART codebase a set of
tests run and a report is generated so the developers know if a contribution
causes any unit tests to fail. 

Py-ART receives vital support for accepting pull requests, bug fixing,
documentation, outreach and education through the ARM program which is part of
the Climate and Environmental Sciences Division of the Office of Science in the
Department of Energy. Due to this, and to ensure the toolkit has maximal impact
a roadmap to chart development priorities for the next five years is needed and
is the subject of this document. The roadmap document is broken down into:

1) This introduction

2) The results of the Py-ART roadmap survey

3) Proposed governance for accepting pull requests

4) Overarching goals for the next five years

5) Specific features that will be a priority for development

We also include a list of papers that have been accepted or are in process that
have made use of Py-ART as a reference at the end of this document. 

The Py-ART Roadmap Survey
=========================
In order to produce a development roadmap we first needed to get the views of
users and stakeholders as to what should be in the toolkit. To this end we
designed the Py-ART Roadmap survey. The survey was hosted on SurveyMonkey and we
got some much appreciated assistance from the ARM outreach office in editing some
questions for clarity. The Survey asked users to self identify as either a
Py-ART user or not and then asked if they would identify as:

1) A person who mainly works with observational data

2) A person who uses a mix of modelling and observational data

3) A person who mainly works with model data

Unfortunately we did not get a statistically significant enough sample to
discriminate between this groups so for this document *all user groups will be
combined* effectively giving two groups: those that do and do not use Py-ART.

The survey had 35 respondents which were solicited by the ARM and Py-ART mailing
lists, Facebook and Twitter. Of those 11 had never used Py-ART and 24 had.

   Figure N: Pie charts showing the split between Py-ART user and non-user
   respondants and aggregated (user/non-user) self identification of
   organization and role within that organization. 


Respondents were presented with a list of possible additions to Py-ART's suite
of algorithms consisting of: 

1) **Ingest of WRF data to the Py-ART grid model.** The ability to ingest WRF
out NetCDF files into the Py-ART Grid data model.

2) **Cell/Object Tracking.** The implimentation of TITAN's cell tracking (Dixon
and Wiener, 1993) or similar to create cell tracks.

3) **Multi-Doppler wind retrievals.** Variational or other retrievals of
meridional, zonal and vertical wind velocities from Doppler velocity
measurements. 

4) **More bulk statistics of grid or radar contents (CFAD, echo top heights etc..).** Functions 
that reduce radar volumes and grids down to descriptive parameters that could be visualized as a time series.

5) **Easier "one step" rainfall retrievals.** Making it
easier to simply go from a radar volume to a rainfall map.

6) **More output formats.**
More formats to write to.

7) **More input formats.** 
More ingests.

8) **Quasi-Vertical Profile reconstruction from a list of radars.** A specific
case of item 4 along the lines of (Ryzhkov et al, 2016).

9) **More data quality code (eg clutter rejection, biological masks..).** Code
to create gatefilters to remove non-meteorological echoes. 

10) **Add the option of Cartopy map backend to the existing basemap in RadarMapDisplay.** The ability 
to use the UK Metoffice developed Cartopy backend for map based displays. Cartopy is newer 
than the existing basemap backend but is likely to have a longer shelf life due to basemap 
not being supported beyond 2020. 

11) **Ability to handle Radar Spectra and perform retrievals on.** Extension of
the Py-ART data model to handle each gate having a spectra consisting of power
as a function of velocity or phase. This will allow for an extension into
spectra based retrievals such as clutter removal by interpolating over the "zero
peak".

12) **More high level retrievals from the literature (Eg DSD, Particle ID..).**
Systematic inclusion of various retrievals dealing with particle size retrieval
and rain/snow/hail/ice retrievals. 

13) **Velocity Azimuth Display wind retrievals.** Ability to retrieve flow
vectors as a function of height. Could include advanced techniques such as DVAD
(Lee et al, 2014). 

Respondents were only presented with the bolded text, the extra information
would have been excessive but it could be assumed that familiarity may have
played some role in voting.



**METHODOLOGY OF THE RANKING:**

A selector drop-down ranks each feature between one and number of options.  
A count of the responses are multiplied against their ranked rank and summed. 
An example score would be three responses for rank 1 would be three points 4 
responses for rank 3 means 16 points added together 19 points.  That sum is 
divided by the total number of responses to that feature giving the feature a 
weighted ranked score, having the lowest score means that feature is the most 
important to the users. The example would yield a rank score of 2.7


Non Py-ART Users
----------------

Those who identified as non-users of Py-ART were asked "What feature would make
you more likely to use Py-ART". In advertising the survey we made a particular
effort to get respondents who do not use Py-ART so we did not suffer from an
"echo-chamber" effect. Figure N shows the results of this question. The most
popular weighted rank for new feature from non-users was "More high level
retrievals". Unsurprisingly the item relating to the mapping back-end Cartopy was
the least popular since a fair assumption is many of the non-users are also
non-Python users and would not even know what Cartopy is. There is no real
sudden decrease anywhere along the rankings.

   Figure N: Average ratings for the question "How likely would these added
   features be to get you to use Py-ART?" aimed at non-users

The survey also asked about barriers that non-users faced to using Py-ART.
Surprisingly the number one barrier was "Difficulty to install" followed by
"Most of my analysis is done by others in our group." The least popular barrier
was "I am not a python user" which is pleasing as it is indicative of a large
uptake of Python in the community.

   Py-ART?"



Py-ART Users
------------

With Py-ART users, in addition to asking what feature they desired the survey
also asked them to identify their favourite feature. Figure N shows the weighted
rankings for the responses. Visualization and plotting was the most popular
feature closely followed by an appreciation for the wide variety of formats that
Py-ART can read. While unsurprising this is in-line with the development
priorities of Py-ART to-date as the team sees the two biggest barriers to new
users of radar data being the reading of exotically formatted files and working
out what those files contain. Rankings decreased gradually with a notable break
when it came to "Knowing VAPS will work with ADI/ARM systems". Even though this
is one of Py-ART's primary aims (to enable PI developed data to integrate easily
with ARM systems) this is not surprising. If anything the development team is a
victim of their own success in marketing Py-ART to the wider community. It does
show, however, we have some work to do in helping DoE funded PIs in using the
toolkit and advocating that funded retrievals be implemented in Py-ART.

   Figure N: 

Figure N shows the weighted ranks for desired new features for existing Py-ART
users. Figure N shows several key differences to figure N. Multi-Doppler
retrievals is now the most popular feature very closely followed by Cell
Tracking. And, notably, more literature based techniques is the lowest desire by
existing users. Perhaps because many of them, using Py-ART's easy to use data
model, have implemented many of these techniques at their home institutions. 

.. figure:: ./images/users_desired_features.png
   :scale: 30 %
   :alt: an image

   Figure N: 

As well as having users pick from feature lists designed by the survey
developers free-form answers were solicited with the questions "what would be
Py-ART's Killer app". Users were allowed to enter three items each so they will
not all be documented here and are available in Appendix 1. The key take aways
are:

- Multi-Doppler retrievals are in high demand from the community. 

- A functionality that allows cross-sections through a radar volume between two
  points is desired. 

- Further desires for better dealiasing.

We took the opportunity to ask users about contributing. There were 18 responses to the question "Have you ever contributed to Py-ART?" Of the 18, 22.2%(4) said Yes via pull request through Github, 5.6%(1) said yes, by intellectual property implemented by someone else, 44.4%(8) said no, but they wanted to and 27%(5) said no and they were not interested in doing so.

Finally we asked those who have not contributed what the barrier was to
contributing.

.. figure:: ./images/user_barriers.png
   :scale: 30 %
   :alt: an image

   Figure N: Average ratings for the question "What is preventing you
   contributing to Py-ART?"

Figure N shows the average ranking with the most common barrier being "Just not
enough time". This is not surprising as many researchers would not be judged
by open source contributions and would not value such in advancing their
careers. The second most common is "I do not think I have done anything worth
contributing". This is more than likely a misunderstanding as even things as
simple as correcting typographical errors in the documentation is a welcome
contribution and small changes are much easier to accept than more substantial
changes. The lowest ranking issue is to do with intellectual property issues.
This is pleasing as it means there are few institutional roadblocks to our users
contributing.

Proposed Governance Structure
=============================
The motivation of this roadmap is to ensure that the effort funded by the ARM
program is responsive to the needs of the stakeholders of the program. A large
task of the lead developer has been in assisting contributors in modifying pull
requests (contributions) so that they can be accepted into Py-ART. While it is
important to have a consistent standard across the codebase many of the tasks
associated with accepting pull requests can be delegated to others in the
community. Currently there are two ad-hoc defined roles in the Py-ART
project: Science Lead and Lead Developer. This roadmap proposes the
introduction of a third role: Associate Developer. The roles will be:

**Science Lead**: Provides high level leadership for the project, organizes outreach
and education and coordinates contributor and stakeholder input to form a long
term vision for the project.

**Lead Developer**: Responsible for overall architecture of the project. Final
arbiter in what pull requests to accept. Develops the required style guidelines
and coordinates the associate developers. Coordinates contributions from
associated developers to a Contributors Guide (and contributes as well).  

**Associate Developers**: Responsible, as time allows, for doing an initial
check of pull requests for suitability and adherence to the Contributors Guide.
Contributes to the Contributors Guide. 

It will be expected that the associate developers will be recognized as key
members of the project and acknowledged accordingly in future publications and
presentations.
