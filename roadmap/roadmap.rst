Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) Roadmap
=========================================

Introduction and Aims
=====================
Everyone one who uses weather radar to do science uses, in one form or another,
radar software. Software is a science enabling piece of infrastructure and good
software minimizes frustration and allows the domain expert to get to 
understanding the phenomena being studied without needing to be an expert on
numerics, data informatics and software engineering.

There are several platforms for interacting with radar data, the open source
variants are well documented in (Heistermann et al 2014). The Python ARM Radar
Toolkit (Py-ART, Helmus and Collis, 2016) is one of these. 

Py-ART grew out of a collection of radar algorithms generated in support of the
new radar capability in the ARM program (Mather and Voyles, 2012). One of the
first contributions was a Linear Programming (LP) technique for separating
propagation polarimetric phase shift from other local impacts (Giangrande el at,
2013). As the collection of both algorithms and radars grew it became clear that
the problem would become intractable unless a carefully designed architecture was designed that allowed application chains to be developer via a common data model approach.

Shortly after, in early 2012 development on Py-ART began in earnest with the
support of the ARM program. In September of 2012 Py-ART was uploaded to the
social coding platform GitHub at https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart. Py-ART was
unofficially bumped to version 1.0.0-Dev in May of 2013 and publicly released.
The first "stable" release was 1.2.0 in February of 2015 and the most recent
release was 1.7.0 in September of 2016. Release notes can be found here: https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart/releases.

   Figure 1: Lines of code by Contributor as a function of time. Note, some
   lines are automatically generated by Cython to C complilation.

Figure 1 shows the growth of the project as a function of time broken down by
contributor. Note that some of the code is C which has been generated by Cython
which inflates the number some what. 

Py-ART has benefited from code from 15 individual contributors. This has been
enabled by careful implementation of unit tests and continuous integration.
Every time a pull request is submitted against the Py-ART codebase a set of
tests run and a report is generated so the developers know if a contribution
causes any unit tests to fail. 

Py-ART receives vital support for accepting pull requests, bug fixing,
documentation, outreach and education through the ARM program which is part of
the Climate and Environmental Sciences Division of the Office of Science in the
Department of Energy. Due to this, and to ensure the toolkit has maximal impact
a roadmap to chart development priorities for the next five years is needed and
is the subject of this document. The roadmap document is broken down into:

1) This introduction

2) The results of the Py-ART roadmap survey

3) Proposed governance for accepting pull requests

4) Overarching goals for the next five years

5) Specific features that will be a priority for development

We also include a list of papers that have been accepted or are in process that
have made use of Py-ART as a reference at the end of this document. 



The Py-ART Roadmap Survey
=========================
Description and methods and lots of images

Proposed Governance Structure
=============================


Overarching Goals for Next Five Years
=====================================
Freeform discussion of where we want to be

Priority Features
=================
In priority order the features we want added either by ARM or features that if
they are in a PR we will be very happy to help with this PR
