Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) Roadmap
=========================================
---------------------------------------------------------------
*Scott Collis, Cory Weber, Jonathan Helmus and Zachary Sherman*
---------------------------------------------------------------


1 Introduction and Aims
=======================
Everyone who uses weather radar for science, in one form or another, uses
radar software. Software is a science enabling piece of infrastructure and good
software minimizes frustration and allows the domain expert to get to 
understanding the phenomena being studied without needing to be an expert on
numerics, data informatics, and software engineering.

There are several platforms for interacting with radar data, the open source
variants are well documented in (Heistermann et al 2014). The Python ARM Radar
Toolkit (Py-ART, Helmus and Collis, 2016) is one of these. 

Py-ART grew out of a collection of radar algorithms generated in support of the
new radar capability in the ARM program (Mather and Voyles, 2012). One of the
first contributions was a Linear Programming (LP) technique for separating
propagation polarimetric phase shift from other local impacts (Giangrande el at,
2013). As the collection of both algorithms and radars grew it became clear that
the problem would become intractable unless a carefully designed architecture was designed that allowed application chains to be developed via a common data model approach.

Shortly after, in early 2012, development on Py-ART began in earnest with the
support of the ARM program. In September of 2012, Py-ART was uploaded to the
social coding platform GitHub at https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart. Py-ART was
unofficially bumped to version 1.0.0-Dev in May of 2013 and publicly released.
The first "stable" release was 1.2.0 in February of 2015 and the most recent
release was 1.7.0 in September of 2016. Release notes can be found here: https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart/releases.

   lines are automatically generated by Cython to C complilation.

Figure 1 shows the growth of the project as a function of time broken down by
contributor. Note that some of the code is C which has been generated by Cython
which inflates the number slightly. 

Py-ART has benefited from code from 15 individual contributors. This has been
enabled by careful implementation of unit tests and continuous integration.
Every time a pull request is submitted against the Py-ART codebase a set of
tests run and a report is generated so the developers know if a contribution
causes any unit tests to fail. 

Py-ART receives vital support for accepting pull requests, bug fixing,
documentation, outreach and education through the ARM program which is part of
the Climate and Environmental Sciences Division of the Office of Science in the
Department of Energy. Due to this, and to ensure the toolkit has maximal impact
a roadmap to chart development priorities for the next five years is needed and
is the subject of this document. 

In summary, in five years time Py-ART will:

1) Be coupled to a third party package for the easy calculation of three
dimensional wind fields from multi-Doppler radars.

2) Have a full suite of algorithms for producing summary statistics of radar
volume contents.

3) Either internally or by coupling to a third party codebase produce object
tracks and information. 

4) Use the Cartopy backend for
plotting data on a map.

5) The introduction of a Radar 
Spectrum data model and class in Py-ART.

6) A clean up and improvement of existing phase processing and attenuation
correction code. 

The details of these features is expanded on in sections 4 and 5. The roadmap document is broken down into:

1) This introduction

2) The results of the Py-ART roadmap survey

3) Proposed governance for accepting pull requests

4) Overarching goals for the next five years

5) Specific features that will be a priority for development

6) Measuring impact and the success of the project

We also include a list of papers that have been accepted or are in process that
have made use of Py-ART as a reference at the end of this document. 

2 The Py-ART Roadmap Survey
===========================
In order to produce a development roadmap we first needed to get the views of
users and stakeholders as to what should be in the toolkit. To this end, we
designed the Py-ART Roadmap survey. The survey was hosted on SurveyMonkey and we
recieved some much appreciated assistance from the ARM outreach office in editing some
questions for clarity. The Survey asked users to self identify as either a
Py-ART user or not and then asked if they would identify as:

1) A person who mainly works with observational data

2) A person who uses a mix of modelling and observational data

3) A person who mainly works with model data

Unfortunately, we did not get a statistically significant enough sample to
discriminate between these groups, so for this document *all user groups will be
combined* effectively giving two groups: those that do and do not use Py-ART.

The survey had 35 respondents which were solicited by the ARM and Py-ART mailing
lists, Facebook and Twitter. Of those 11 had never used Py-ART and 24 had. 

.. figure:: ./images/three_panel.png

   :alt: an image
   
   Figure 2: Pie charts showing the split between Py-ART user and non-user
   respondants and aggregated (user/non-user) self identification of
   organization and role within that organization. 


Respondents were presented with a list of possible additions to Py-ART's suite
of algorithms consisting of: 

1) **Ingest of WRF data to the Py-ART grid model.** The ability to ingest WRF
out NetCDF files into the Py-ART Grid data model.

2) **Cell/Object Tracking.** The implimentation of TITAN's cell tracking (Dixon
and Wiener, 1993) or similar to create cell tracks.

3) **Multi-Doppler wind retrievals.** Variational or other retrievals of
meridional, zonal, and vertical wind velocities from Doppler velocity
measurements. 

4) **More bulk statistics of grid or radar contents (CFAD, echo top heights etc..).** Functions 
that reduce radar volumes and grids down to descriptive parameters that could be visualized as a time series.

5) **Easier "one step" rainfall retrievals.** Making it
easier to simply go from a radar volume to a rainfall map.

6) **More output formats.**
More formats to write to.

7) **More input formats.** 
More ingests.

8) **Quasi-Vertical Profile reconstruction from a list of radars.** A specific
case of item 4 along the lines of (Ryzhkov et al, 2016).

9) **More data quality code (eg clutter rejection, biological masks..).** Code
to create gatefilters to remove non-meteorological echoes. 

10) **Add the option of Cartopy map backend to the existing basemap in RadarMapDisplay.** The ability 
to use the UK Metoffice developed Cartopy backend for map based displays. Cartopy is newer 
than the existing basemap backend but is likely to have a longer shelf life due to basemap 
not being supported beyond 2020. 

11) **Ability to handle Radar Spectra and perform retrievals on.** Extension of
the Py-ART data model to handle each gate having a spectra consisting of power
as a function of velocity or phase. This will allow for an extension into
spectra based retrievals such as clutter removal by interpolating over the "zero
peak".

12) **More high level retrievals from the literature (Eg DSD, Particle ID..).**
Systematic inclusion of various retrievals dealing with particle size retrieval
and rain/snow/hail/ice retrievals. 

13) **Velocity Azimuth Display wind retrievals.** Ability to retrieve flow
vectors as a function of height. Could include advanced techniques such as DVAD
(Lee et al, 2014). 

Respondents were only presented with the bolded text, the extra information
would have been excessive but it could be assumed that familiarity may have
played some role in voting.



**METHODOLOGY OF THE RANKING:**

A selector drop-down ranks each feature between one and number of options.  
A count of the responses are multiplied against their ranked rank and summed. 
An example score would be 3 responses for rank 1 would be 3 points, 4 
responses for rank 3 means 12 points then added together for 15 points. That sum is 
divided by the total number of responses to that feature giving the feature a 
weighted ranked score, having the lowest score means that feature is the most 
important to the users. The example would yield a rank score of 2.14


2.1 Non Py-ART Users
--------------------

Those who identified as non-users of Py-ART were asked "What feature would make
you more likely to use Py-ART". In advertising the survey we made a particular
effort to get respondents who do not use Py-ART so we did not suffer from an
"echo-chamber" effect. Figure 3 shows the results of this question. The most
popular weighted rank for new feature from non-users was "More high level
retrievals". Unsurprisingly the item relating to the mapping back-end Cartopy was
the least popular since a fair assumption is many of the non-users are also
non-Python users and would not even know what Cartopy is. There is no real
sudden decrease anywhere along the rankings.

   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: an image

   Figure 3: Average ratings for the question "How likely would these added
   features be to get you to use Py-ART?" aimed at non-users

The survey also asked about barriers that non-users faced to using Py-ART.
Figure 4 shows the weighted responses, surprisingly the number one barrier was "Difficulty to install" followed by
"Most of my analysis is done by others in our group." The least popular barrier
was "I am not a python user", which is pleasing as it is indicative of a large
uptake of Python in the community.

   Figure 4: Average ratings for the question "What is preventing you using
   Py-ART?"



2.2 Py-ART Users
----------------

With Py-ART users, in addition to asking what feature they desired the survey
also asked them to identify their favourite feature. Figure 5 shows the weighted
rankings for the responses. Visualization/plotting was the most popular
feature closely followed by an appreciation for the wide variety of formats that
Py-ART can read. While unsurprising, this is in-line with the development
priorities of Py-ART to-date as the team sees the two biggest barriers to new
users of radar data being the reading of exotically formatted files and working
out what those files contain. Rankings decreased gradually with a notable break
when it came to "Knowing VAPS will work with ADI/ARM systems". Even though this
is one of Py-ART's primary aims (to enable PI developed data to integrate easily
with ARM systems), this is not surprising. If anything the development team is a
victim of their own success in marketing Py-ART to the wider community. It does
show, however, we have some work to do in helping DoE funded PIs in using the
toolkit and advocating that funded retrievals be implemented in Py-ART. 

.. figure:: ./images/users_favourite_existing_features.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: an image

   Figure 5: Average rating for the question to users "What is your favourite
   feature of Py-ART?" 

Figure 6 shows the weighted ranks for desired new features for existing Py-ART
users. Figure 6 shows several key differences to figure 3. Multi-Doppler
retrievals is now the most popular feature very closely followed by Cell
Tracking. And, notably, more literature based techniques is the lowest desire by
existing users. Perhaps because many of them, using Py-ART's easy to use data
model, have implemented many of these techniques at their home institutions. 

.. figure:: ./images/users_desired_features.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: an image

   Figure 6: Average rating for the question to users "What features would you
   like to see added to Py-ART?" 

As well as having users pick from feature lists designed by the survey,
developers free-form answers were solicited with the questions "what would be
Py-ART's Killer app". Users were allowed to enter three items each so they will
not all be documented here and are available in Appendix 1. The key take aways
are:

- Multi-Doppler retrievals are in high demand from the community. 

- A functionality that allows cross-sections through a radar volume between two
  points is desired. 

- Further desires for better dealiasing.

We took the opportunity to ask users about contributing. There were 18 responses to the question "Have you ever contributed to Py-ART?" Of the 18, 22.2%(4) said Yes via pull request through Github, 5.6%(1) said yes, by intellectual property implemented by someone else, 44.4%(8) said no, but they wanted to and 27%(5) said no and they were not interested in doing so.

Finally we asked those who have not contributed what the barrier was to
contributing.

.. figure:: ./images/user_barriers.png
   :scale: 50 %
   :alt: an image

   Figure 7: Average ratings for the question "What is preventing you
   contributing to Py-ART?"

Figure 7 shows the average ranking with the most common barrier being "Just not
enough time". This is not surprising, as many researchers would not be judged
by open source contributions and would not value such in advancing their
careers. The second most common is "I do not think I have done anything worth
contributing". This is more than likely a misunderstanding as even things as
simple as correcting typographical errors in the documentation is a welcome
contribution and small changes are much easier to accept than more substantial
changes. The lowest ranking issue is to do with intellectual property issues.
This is pleasing, as it means there are few institutional roadblocks to our users
contributing.

3 Proposed Governance Structure
===============================
The motivation of this roadmap is to ensure that the effort funded by the ARM
program is responsive to the needs of the stakeholders of the program. A large
task of the lead developer has been in assisting contributors in modifying pull
requests (contributions) so that they can be accepted into Py-ART. While it is
important to have a consistent standard across the codebase, many of the tasks
associated with accepting pull requests can be delegated to others in the
community. Currently there are two ad-hoc defined roles in the Py-ART
project: Science Lead and Lead Developer. This roadmap proposes the
introduction of a third role: Associate Developer. The roles will be:

**Science Lead**: Provides high level leadership for the project, organizes outreach
and education and coordinates contributor and stakeholder input to form a long
term vision for the project.

**Lead Developer**: Responsible for overall architecture of the project. Final
arbiter in what pull requests to accept. Develops the required style guidelines
and coordinates the associate developers. Coordinates contributions from
associated developers to a Contributors Guide (and contributes as well).  

**Associate Developers**: Responsible, as time allows, for doing an initial
check of pull requests for suitability and adherence to the Contributors Guide.
Contributes to the Contributors Guide. 

In seeking Associate Developers it will be important to seek diversity to ensure 
there is no single point of failure in providing support to Py-ART. Ideally the project would have 2-3 Associate Developers.
It will be expected that the associate developers will be recognized as key
members of the project and are acknowledged accordingly in future publications and
presentations. 



4 Overarching Goals for Next Five Years
=======================================
The aim of Py-ART is to lower barriers to doing science with radar data, in
particular for Department of Energy stakeholders. From the survey results it is
clear that there is a large demand for Multi-Doppler winds. However there is an
ongoing collaboration which is working on a package that *depends* on Py-ART so
a top goal for the development team is to ensure that this package works well
with Py-ART and calculation and algorithms required for Multi-Doppler work well
including advection correction, gridding and dealasing. 

As ARM executes a plan to correct and calibrate many of the 30+ radars in its
network, it is expected that the data volume residing at the ARM Archive will
grow to a point that downloading is no longer feasible. Py-ART can play a major role
in on-site processing and *dimensional reduction*. That is, Py-ART can be used
in-situ and generate descriptive metadata about radar volumes. For example CFADs, (Yueter and
Houze 1995) and QVPs (Ryzhkov et al, 2016) that are easier to download and can
guide further data discovery. Accordingly code that can achieve this, especially
novel new techniques in providing summary data will be prioritized. 

In the roadmap survey, the need for cell tracking was raised. In general, it is
preferred that code dealing with Py-ART generated grids becomes part of a
codebase that depends on Py-ART (See Appendix 3) allowing the core code to focus on applications
dealing with radial data. However, since there is a clearly articulated need,
Py-ART will accept code that performs actions similar to that of (Dixon and
Wiener 1993) in retrieving object tracks and information from Py-ART grid
objects. If a community package is developed in Python that can fill the needs
of the community, then the developers will ensure that Py-ART works with that
code base. 

While it was not raised as a priority in the survey, there is a practical need to
find an alternative geospatial library to the Basemap codebase. To this end, the
development team will invest time to implement the Cartopy package as a mapping
backend. This is necessitated by the phasing out of Basemap by 2020 due to lack
of support. Initially Cartopy will be an optional backend (ie not a required
dependency of Py-ART). The development team and advanced users will work with
the Cartopy team in reporting desired functionality so that it can become the
primary backend for plotting radar data on maps. 

There are two items which scored highly with non-users but not with users: A
data model for radar spectra and the addition of more retrieval code from the
literature. To grow the impact of the project, we need to grow the userbase. In
particular, we need to engage with the cloud radar community as a key stakeholder
in the ARM program. To this end, we propose to add (or accept pull requests) that
add the capability to interact with radar spectra data. This has the added
benefit that the Scientific Python stack has a large number of signal processing
algorithms which could potentially provide a rich ecosystem of retrievals for
producing radar moments. 

Finally, Py-ART has several algorithms that were written early in its lifetime
which need improvement. Specifically, the Linear Programming based phase
retrieval technique (Giangrande et al 2013) has seen several improvements (paper
in final stages of acceptance) and
needs further automation (eg easier application to different frequencies) and
the attenuation correction code (Gu et al, 2011) also needs to be improved or
replaced. And finally, Py-ART would benefit from contributions dealing more with
basic polarimetric quality control such as (Cao et al, 2016). 


5 Priority Features
===================
The Development team will prioritize the acceptance of Pull requests and perform
targeted strategic development that adds
the following features:

1) **Support multi-Doppler efforts**: Code that directly impacts the preparation of data into dynamical retrievals
including, but not limited to: Advection correction, improved dealiasing,
multi-timestep gridding (performing advection correction while gridding) and improved gridding.

2) **Volume summary statistics**: Code that reduces the dimensionality of the contents of a radar volume, be it
from a radar or grid object. Examples would be CFADs, QVPs, VADs, echo top
heights, Statistical Coverage Product (SCP, May and Lane, 2009), and simple
statistics. 

3) **Object tracking**: Titan like (Dixon and Wiener, 1993) that can identify and
return locations of objects and their Lagrangian evolution. This will be useful
for cloud and precipitation radars and may enable Py-ART to be used in an
adaptively scanning system. It would also help in situational awareness during
field programs (for example, directing aircraft and other assets). 

4) **Cartopy backend**: Add the option of using Cartopy to RadarMapDisplay and
GridMapDisplay.

5) **Support for radar spectra**: A new data model and class
pyart.core.radar_spectra that allows the storage of spectra as a function of
time and range gate. 

6) **Fixing existing processing code**: Clean up and improvement of existing
phase processing and attenuation correction code. Further (optional) automation
using radar metedata to guess coefficients.  


6 Measuring Impact
==================
As a Department of Energy Supported project it is important but not sufficient
to have a roadmap. It is important to monitor impact in order to justify
investment and measure the success of the roadmap. The impact of Py-ART can be measured three ways:

1) **Growing the number of users and installs**: While it is difficult to get exact
statistics, several Py-ART distribution channels provide information of how wide
spread the usage of the toolkit is. For example, figure 8 shows that the main
repository is viewed by over 100 unique visitors every week and installed 9
times. Success would mean growing this number. Truly metricing this aspect will
require periodic surveys. We recommend that surveys are carried out in at the
end of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th years of the roadmap. 

.. figure:: ./images/gitstats.png
   :scale: 140 %
   :alt: an image

   Figure 8: Number of page views and clones (installs) of the main GitHub
   repository in a two week period. As the survey showed that the majority of
   installs are using Annaconda this graph represents a small fraction of the
   userbase. 

2) **Number and success of dependant projects**: Appendix 2 shows projects that
require Py-ART as a dependency. In order to be sustainable, Py-ART needs to have
a clearly defined scope and the needs of the community outside of this scope are better
served with new packages. Therefore, an increasing number and increasing
popularity of packages that depend on Py-ART is a measure of success.  

3) **Papers and presentations using Py-ART**: Publications are treated by many
user facilities as a metric of scientific impact. To date, in just over three 
years since it was first publicly released, Py-ART has been used in 10
publications. A rate of just over three per year. A metric of success will be to
grow this number. Py-ART includes a message on start up encouraging users to
acknowledge the ARM program and cite (Helmus and Collis, 2016). We will track
and record instances of this appearing in major journals and encourage (via the
Py-ART email list, Facebook page and Twitter feed) users to self report so we
can build a Py-ART publications database.

Over the next five years, the success of this roadmap will be judged by more
users, a richer ecosystem of applications, and a large body of literature that
made use of the Python ARM Radar Toolkit.

Appendix 2: Packages that make use of Py-ART
============================================
**ARTView https://github.com/nguy/artview**
ARTview is an interactive GUI viewer that is built on top of the Py-ART toolkit. It allows one to easily scroll through a directory of weather radar data files and visualize the data. All file types available in Py-ART can be opened with the ARTview browser.

You can interact with data files through "Plugins". Many functions from the Py-ART package can be selected. In addition, ARTview plugins allow querying data by selecting regions or points visually.

**SingleDop https://github.com/nasa/SingleDop**
SingleDop is a software module, written in the Python programming language, that will retrieve two-dimensional low-level winds from either real or simulated Doppler radar data. It mimics the functionality of the algorithm described in the following reference:
- Xu et al., 2006: Background error covariance functions for vector wind analyses using Doppler-radar radial-velocity observations. Q. J. R. Meteorol. Soc., 132, 2887-2904.  

The interface is simplified to a single line of code in the end user's Python scripts, making implementation of the algorithm in their research analyses very easy. The software package also interfaces well with other open source radar packages, such as the [Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART)](https://github.com/ARM-DOE/pyart). Simple visualization (including vector and contour plots) and save/load routines (to preserve analysis results) are also provided.


**PyTDA https://github.com/nasa/PyTDA**
software providing Python functions that will estimate turbulence from Doppler radar data. It is tested and working under Python 2.7 and 3.4.

**DualPol https://github.com/nasa/DualPol**
This is an object-oriented Python module that facilitates precipitation retrievals (e.g., hydrometeor type, precipitation rate, precipitation mass, particle size distribution information) from polarimetric radar data. It leverages existing open source radar software packages to perform all-in-one QC and retrievals that are then easily visualized or saved using existing software.

**CSU Radar Tools https://github.com/CSU-Radarmet/CSU_RadarTools**
Python tools for polarimetric radar retrievals.

This codebase was developed at Colorado State University by numerous people, including Brenda Dolan, Brody Fuchs, Kyle Wiens, Rob Cifelli, Larry Carey, Timothy Lang, and others.

Currently, fuzzy-logic-based hydrometeor identification, blended rainfall, DSD retrievals, and liquid/ice mass calculations are supported. There is also an algorithm that uses a finite impulse response (FIR) filter to process differential phase and calculate specific differential phase. Finally, there are some tools to do rudimentary QC on the data.
