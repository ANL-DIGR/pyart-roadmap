The Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) Roadmap
=============================================

General Information
-------------------
The Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART[1]), is an open source Python module containing a growing collection of weather radar algorithms and utilities build on top of the Scientific Python stack and distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license. 

Py-ART is used by the `Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility <http://www.arm.gov>`_ for working with data from a number of precipitation and cloud radars, but has been designed so that it can be used by others in the radar and atmospheric communities to examine, processes, and analyze data from many types of weather radars. It is estimated that Py-ART has over a hundred active users with thousands of downloads from GitHub, pip and conda installs.  

This toolkit contains a variety of utilities that can be strung together to produce applications
for:

* Reading Radar data.
* Correcting radar data in antenna coordinates.
* Mapping data to a Cartesian Grid.
* Performing retrievals on this mapped data.
* Doing calculations on the retievals.
* And finally writing both radial and Cartesian data to documented NetCDF files.

The Roadmap
-----------

Py-ART has been a very useful program that allows for radar data to be interpreted with ease. Py-ART is ever growing and improving, and with a growing contributor community from different backgrounds, new tools are always suggested and added to help Py-ART become a much more powerful program for the radar community. A roadmap was creating to provide a plan and information for the future progression of Py-ART through DOE-funded and voluntary contributions.  

The roadmap provides:

* The coding statistics of Py-ART consisting of lines, files, and contributors.
* A survey providing information on user background, usage, suggested additions, and overall comments of Py-ART.
* Prioritize funding.
* A 5-year outline development plan for Py-ART.
