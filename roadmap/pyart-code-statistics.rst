Py-ART Coding Statistics
========================

Since Py-ART's introduction, there have been a variety of different types of code and contributors present in its history to date. To have a better understanding of the details, a variety of statistics were generated using `GitStats <http://gitstats.sourceforge.net/>`_. These statistics offer insight on Py-ART's coding history, and by doing so, it is then possible to estimate potential future coding habits.
