The Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART) Roadmap
=============================================

The Python ARM Radar Toolkit, Py-ART, is an open source Python module 
containing a growing collection of weather radar algorithms and utilities
build on top of the Scientific Python stack and distributed under the
3-Clause BSD license. Py-ART is used by the 
`Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Climate Research Facility 
<http://www.arm.gov>`_ for working with data from a number of precipitation
and cloud radars, but has been designed so that it can be used by others in
the radar and atmospheric communities to examine, processes, and analyze
data from many types of weather radars. 

Developers are compiling a long-term development plan known as a roadmap. This document will help prioritize DOE-funded and voluntary contributions to the toolkit going forward.
