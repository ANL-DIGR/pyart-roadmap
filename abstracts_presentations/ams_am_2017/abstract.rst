Building a roadmap for a mid-sized community software project: Perspectives from Py-ART
=======================================================================================
*Scott Collis, Jonathan Helmus and Cory Weber*

The Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART, [1]) is an environment for interacting
with and extracting insight from weather radar data. While it is difficult to
track total usage we estimate Py-ART has over a hundred active users with
thousands of downloads from GitHub, pip and conda installs.  Py-ART has fifteen
contributors and a very diverse funding background, led by the Department of
Energy's ARM program. It is important for a project of this size to have a vision
for how development will proceed over the next five years.  The project must serve the
needs of ARM stakeholders as well as the needs of the wider community to ensure
broad uptake and longevity. This presentation will report the results of the
Py-ART roadmap survey and outline a five year plan for development
prioritization. The roadmap prioritizes both directly funded development and
support for implementation of unsolicited pull requests to the Py-ART
package.
