The Python ARM Radar Toolkit development roadmap
================================================

**Scott Collis, Jonthan Helmus, Zachary Sherman and Cory Weber**

Everyone in the ASR and ARM programs uses software. From operating systems to
specialized analysis packages software helps automate repetitive tasks and good
software saves vital time in addressing scientific questions. The Python-ARM
Radar Toolkit (Py-ART, Helmus and Collis 2016) is a Python based architecture
for interacting with data collected from weather radar. As Py-ART enters its
fourth year of release, with a large and diverse user-base, it is necessary to
focus ARM supported efforts and community contributions on a set of capabilities
that best serve DoE stakeholders and have the greatest impact on CESD science.
This is the purpose of Py-ART Roadmap. The Roadmap charts the next five years of
development for Py-ART, provides guidance to Py-ART contributors and prioritizes ARM assistance for implementing contributed packages. The design of the roadmap is in a consultative phase and the purpose of this presentation is to showcase the Roadmap in its current form and solicit feedback from the Science Team.
